            <p class="about">If you’re working in a team and need some team building, or simply need a positive connection boost, you can try the “Fly on the wall”-method.</p><p class="about">The way it goes is that you take turns being the fly on the wall. So one team member turns around, facing away from the others, and only listens while the other members share their positive thoughts about them as if they’re not there for three minutes. Basically having a conversation about the fly and talking about all the things they like about them.</p><p class="about">Do this for every member and afterwards you’ll all feel better about yourselves and each other!
