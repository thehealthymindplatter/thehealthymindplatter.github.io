            <p class="about">Down time means to let go of all the things you must do and everything that stresses you. Just picking up your phone when you are on a break does not relax your mind and will not help you focus better. Try to limit the amount of impressions you recieve during your break.<br><br>
            
            Taking a walk in nature has tremendous effects when it comes to lowering stress levels. <strong>For your next break - try to go outside.</strong> As a challenge - leave your phone and headphones at home. Do not let yourself be distracted by music in your ears or notifications in your pocket.<br><br>
        
            If you have access to nature - that's great. Otherwise, try to just take a walk around your neighborhood. Let your mind wander and come back with new perspectives and energy.</p>
