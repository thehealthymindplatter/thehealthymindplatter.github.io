            <p class="about">Sometimes just to get your body moving is all you need. If you don't have enough time to work out you could still be active by talking a walk.<br>
                <br>Get your shoes on and head outside for at least 30 minutes. Allow your body to do what it was designed to do through thousands of years of evolution - move around. It will raise your heart rate and circulate more oxygen through the blood.</br>
                <br>Stroll around and enjoy your neighbourhood, go to an area you haven't been before, use your feet!</p></br>
